                          The global consulting and auditing industry is valued at nearly $240 billion, dominated by international networks and global strategy majors. Despite India’s world-class talent pool, domestic firms remain marginal players, particularly in high-value audits and consulting, partly due to structural and regulatory barriers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          India’s leadership has repeatedly emphasized the need to build indigenous professional service giants. While government efforts so far have largely concentrated on the auditing sector, it is equally important to prioritise the consulting business, which represents a far larger share of the revenue potential and strategic influence in the professional services industry. The recent FTAs of India has opened opportunities for Indian consultancy firms to expand their presence abroad.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          India needs this vision to ensure that its talent, which is currently working for global firms and delivers value abroad, is fully utilised within the country. India needs to contain its reliance on multinational corporations for strategic audits and consulting for strengthening its economic sovereignty, thereby moving towards achieving the goal of Atmanirbhar Bharat. At the same time, India must focus on building global brands in areas such as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), audit, advisory, compliance, and multidisciplinary consultancy, including IT services, tapping into its vast export potential. In addition, it is equally important to strengthen institutions, raise professional standards, and foster a culture of innovation that supports long-term ecosystem development within the country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Study of International firms reveals the strengths of International firms as under, which are not available with Indian firms:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          International firms follow an integrated multidisciplinary model, offering a wide range of services—auditing, tax and legal, consulting, deal advisory, and specialised areas like ESG, forensics, and technology. This approach allows them to act as one-stop solution providers, addressing the requirement of client with coordinated expertise, combining global reach with local knowledge, and delivering end-to-end support across the entire business lifecycle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          International firms operate through vast global networks that span numerous countries, enabling them to serve multinational clients with the same standards and quality across the world. These networks ensure scale by mobilising large pools of expertise and resources, while consistency is maintained through uniform methodologies, shared technology platforms, and global best practices. This structure allows the international firms to deliver seamless, reliable, and comparable services worldwide, making them trusted partners for global businesses and governments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Presently, merger between fellow subsidiary companies belonging to the same group (i.e. having same holding company) is not covered under section 233. It is proposed that such mergers may also be included in section 233 since these would be similar to mergers between holding company and unlisted subsidiary companies. It is proposed to cover only unlisted fellow subsidiaries under this category.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The International firms have strong and well-known brands that acts as “trust multiplier”. Because of their reputation, their clients, feel confident that their work is reliable, and of good quality. This trust helps them build stronger client relationships, hire the best talent, and win big projects around the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The international firms operate through partnership structures where senior professionals are partners who own and manage the firm. This model creates strong accountability, as partners are directly responsible for the quality of work and client relationships, while also sharing the risks and rewards of the business. At the same time, it supports retention by offering talented professionals a clear path to partnership, motivating them to stay and grow within their firm, thereby strengthening long-term stability and commitment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The International firms strengthen their services through deep technology alliances with global leaders enabling them to deliver advanced IT solutions to their clients. In addition, they have developed their own proprietary platforms which enhance audit quality, data analytics, and client services. Such blend mix of alliance and their own proprietary platforms give them a strong edge in combining technology with professional expertise to provide more efficient, reliable, and innovative solutions worldwide.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The International firms invest heavily in leadership academies, professional certifications, and global mobility programs to build and retain top talent. These initiatives equip professionals with advanced skills, international exposure, and leadership capabilities, ensuring they stay ahead in the rapidly changing business environment. By adopting continuous learning and offering global career opportunities, the International firms not only enhance service quality for their clients but also strengthen employee engagement, loyalty, and long-term growth within the firm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The government and regulatory bodies have taken several measures to strengthen the position of Indian audit firms and create a more level playing field with global players.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In April 2021, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular aimed at diversifying the auditing business of financial institutions. It restricted the number of audits by a single firm to a maximum of four Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), eight Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs), and eight Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). It also made joint audits mandatory for large banks with assets exceeding ₹15,000 crore. Previously, around 250 major banks and NBFCs were primarily audited by just six large firms. Under the new limits, these firms can collectively handle a maximum of 72 assignments, with the remaining business opening up to Indian firms that offer cost-effective services and can build capabilities.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has also taken steps to enhance the competitiveness of Indian firms against the International firms. Currently, out of 95,000 firms registered with ICAI, about 70,000 are proprietorship firms, and only 400 Indian firms have more than 10 partners. In contrast, some of the international firms have much higher number of partners. To bridge this gap, ICAI initiated measures to allow Indian firms to combine and form larger aggregate entities with greater operational capacity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In India, professionals such as chartered accountants, company secretaries, and lawyers face restrictions on advertising and branding due to regulations set by their governing bodies. These rules were originally intended to uphold dignity, ethics, and independence in the profession. However, this ban limits Indian firms from building strong brands and competing on a global scale, especially against multinational firms, which can freely advertise and establish market visibility abroad. There should be a distinction between professional brand-building and solicitation/advertising.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In India, restrictions on multidisciplinary partnerships (MDPs) prevent professionals such as chartered accountants, company secretaries, lawyers, and actuaries from working together under a single firm structure. As a result, they often operate in silos, limiting collaboration and the ability to offer integrated services like those provided by International firms. ICAI’s 2021 MDP framework is also restrictive as it permits only six professions and excludes MBAs, IT, insolvency experts etc. The three Professional institutes, i.e., ICAI, ICSI and ICoAI, need to establish systems and environment for professional development, which includes shared common resources for smaller firms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In India, licensing for professional services is governed by different regulators overseeing specific professions such as chartered accountancy, company secretarial practice, law, and actuarial science. Each operates under its own rules and restrictions, often without coordination, which creates silos and limits collaboration. This fragmented framework makes it difficult to build multidisciplinary firms, reduces competitiveness against International players, and prevents the development of Indian firms meeting diverse and complex client needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          GFR allows procuring entities the flexibility to relax certain provisions in respect of startups and MSME but in practice, sometimes process followed in procurement does not create a level playing field between Indian entities and International entities. In high-value consulting, audit, and advisory assignments, stringent eligibility conditions such as high global turnover, extensive international experience, and global presence tend to disadvantage Indian firms, even when they possess the necessary expertise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In the definition of “Indian” under the 2017 Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order, which allows foreign-owned firms to qualify as Indian based only on local value addition, ignoring ownership and technical know-how. Another issue is that sometimes technical qualifications are evaluated at the firm level rather than the individual level, favoring global companies with established track records.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Indian professional firms largely operate in standalone silos with limited access to global collaboration platforms, which restricts their ability to share knowledge, leverage international best practices, and serve multinational clients seamlessly.
